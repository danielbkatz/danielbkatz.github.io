I"Ù<p>There‚Äôs a problem with the oft-heard-in-intro-stats-courses phrase ‚Äúcorrelation does not imply causation.‚Äù I think it gives statistics students the wrong impression, if not carefully flushed out, about the differences between random variables, estimates, and estimands. The phrase also provides a perfect opportunity to induce some thoughts about sampling distributions, chance, and p-values. This was a post I drew up quickly but always wanted to distribute to an earler version of me.</p>
