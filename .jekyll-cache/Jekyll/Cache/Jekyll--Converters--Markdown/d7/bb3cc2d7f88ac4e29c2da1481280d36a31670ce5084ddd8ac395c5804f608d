I"È<p>There‚Äôs a problem with the oft-heard-in-intro-stats-courses phrase ‚Äúcorrelation does not imply causation.‚Äù I think it gives statistics students the wrong impression, if not carefully flushed out, about the differences between random variables, estimates, and estimands. The phrase also provides a perfect opportunity to induce some thoughts about sampling distributions, chance, and p-values. This was a post I drew up quickly but always wanted to distribute to an earler version of me.</p>

<p>The idea seems simple: Just because there‚Äôs statistical correlation in the present does not mean that that there is a real world causal relationship (a complicated term, it turns out) between x and y. For instance, x could have a high correlation with y but actually, w is simply a mutual cause of x and y. Or something like that.</p>

<p>The phrase is problematic because it‚Äôs actually not accurate.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The first problem is that the only thing that may indicate a causal relationship statistically is correlation. The more accurate phrase might be something like, ‚Äúcorrelation does not <strong><em>necessarily</em></strong> imply causation‚Äù</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next problem is that, paradoxically, the phrase does not go far enough. Correlation present in data does not even indicate a real world relationship, let alone a causal one!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Point 2 can be demonstrated. We‚Äôll generate completely random distributions and then correlate them. Then we‚Äôll do this over and over and look at how the correlations values vary.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start by generating two random normal distributions of size 20, $\mu$ is 0, $\sigma$ is 1.</p>
