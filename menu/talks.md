# Conference Presentations:

## Complex Constructs and Item Selection
[Presentation from AERA 2019 with Karen Nylund-Gibson and Michael Furlong]({{ site.url }}{% link assets/Presentations/AERA_2019/AERA_presi_2019_SWB.pdf %})

Using self-report survey items administered to 1,908 high school students, it is
shown via latent class analysis with distal outcomes that a researcher would likely come
to the same conclusions whether using a one item measure of life satisfaction or several
items traditionally used to measure subjective well-being (SWB). This research
emphasizes the difficulties of being able to make between-person measurement claims
in the realm of self-report surveys, in general.
