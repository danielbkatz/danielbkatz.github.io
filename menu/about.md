I'm currently an ontology engineer at NWEA where I work on projects related to educational measurement, curriculum development, and instructional recommendation systems. My background in academia was a mix of statistics and sub-fields of philosophy - philosophy of measurement & philosophy of language. This drew me to ontology in a philosophical sense and trying to bring these frameworks to measurement in the human sciences. I work to develop conceptual clarity (what is *it* that we measure when we talk about assessment in education, psychology, or similar?). 

## What might an ontology engineer do?
Good question - here is a rough and broad example:
1. Work with subject matter experts like learning scientists in developing conceptual clarity around the things relevant to an organization or scientific field and how these things  (e.g. educational standards, articulated student abilities, assessment items).
2. Work with consumers of the ontology (e.g. machine learning engineers, data scientists, data engineers, subject matter experts on other teams) to consider how the ontology should be structured
3. Move these semantics into a machine readable language (such as the Web Ontology Language). 
4. Aligning data to this ontology, linking data across fields, ideally reducing ambiguity around internal vocabularies or what an organization's data refer to.
5. Developing design patterns, data models, and querying methods enabling machine learning engineers, data scientists, 

## What other interests do I have?
I continue to chip away at projects related to academic interests from my PhD studies. Substantively, I maintain an interest in literacy and reading research as well as concepts of fairness in educational testing and psychometrics. On the statistical front, I’m interested in item response theory (particularly Rasch modelling), and general causal modelling, especially in service of program evaluation. How we use statistics to know what’s true, make decisions, and update beliefs is a topic that blends nicely with some of the program evaluation work I've consulted on.
