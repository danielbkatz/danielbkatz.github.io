Iâ€™m currently an ontology engineer at NWEA where I work on projects related to educational measurement, curriculum development, and instructional recommendation systems. My background in academia was a mix of statistics and sub-fields of philosophy - philosophy of measurement & philosophy of language. This drew me to ontology in a philosophical sense and trying to bring these concept systems to fields such as psychometrics. I work to develop conceptual clarity (what is it that we measure when we talk about assessment in education, psychology, or similar?). 

I'm always curious about conceptual foundations of quantitative modeling practices such as psychometrics or causal inference. I have more information about what an ontology engineer is and how I became one - [about me](https://dbkatz.com/about/)!
