Iâ€™m currently an ontology engineer at NWEA where I work on projects related to educational measurement, curriculum development, and instructional recommendation systems. My background in academia was a mix of statistics and sub-fields of philosophy - philosophy of measurement & philosophy of language. This drew me to ontology in a philosophical sense and trying to bring these concept systems to fields such as psychometrics. I work to develop conceptual clarity (what is it that we measure when we talk about assessment in education, psychology, or similar?). 

I also continue work in areas related to philosophy measurement (and related ethics of human measurement), philosophy of languages, psychometrics (in particular the Rasch model and explanatory item response theory models), causal inference, and program evaluation. I'm always curious about conceptual foundations of modeling practices such as psychometrics, and this informs my work. I have more information in the [about](https://dbkatz.com/about/) section of this site!
