I’m a graduate student in the Gevirtz Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I’m interested in a number of issues related to how we use statistics to know what’s true, make decisions, and update beliefs. While I find doing statistics rewarding and fun, I’m particualrly interested in issues related to the philosophy of measurement and probability and how philosophy can help us clarify research aims and claims. On the statistical front, I’m interested in item response theory (particularly Rasch modelling), and general causal modelling. My research projects span thinking about fairness in testing and assessment, the role of language in human measurement, general policy work, and program evaluation.

I plan to use this site to post the occassional R tutorial, write about things that interest me (and maybe others), as well as keep a record of my projects.
