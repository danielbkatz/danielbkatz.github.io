      <description>There’s a problem with the various versions of the oft-heard-in-intro-stats-courses phrase “correlation does not imply causation.” It gives early statistics students the wrong impressions.
The idea seems simple: Just because there’s statistical correlation in the present does not mean that that there is a real world causal relationship (a complicated term, it turns out) between x and y. For instance, x could have a high correlation with y but actually, w is simply a mutual cause of x and y.</description>
