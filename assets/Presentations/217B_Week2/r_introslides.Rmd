### General Strategy


+ My goal is to get us up and running - doing is the best learning

+ Provide you with some quality resources for continuing to learn via links like [_**this**_](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/r/info)
  
+ I won't emphasize code-style best practices except in a few cases (but these will only be for cases that make life easier)

+ I think it's important to focus on ideas and functions

+ For more on style/best practices, [_**click here**_](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)

+ Learning how to trouble shoot is important

# What is R?

+ R is a software and scripting language  
  

+ Like any other language it has syntax (for now think, "rules" of language)  
  

+ R comes with a variety of built-in functions  
  
  
+ R is desiged for statistics, but you can do lots with it 
  + build websites
  + write documents in Latex
  + Create slides for presentations, etc.
---
class: middle
  
# You can learn R! 

+ It is quickly becoming the statistical language of choice in academic and non-academic circles    

--
  
+ `R Packages` are making tasks more accessible to non-programmers like me  


--
  
+ R allows for sharing code: we won't cover Github, but please [_**check it out**_](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)  

--
  
+ Scripting forces us to slow down and think  

--

+ We can do everything in one place (data cleaning, plotting, modeling, etc)

# Probability, odds, logits  
  

+ In this class, we'll be operating a lot with probability, odds, and log odds  
  
  
--

+ As mentioned in course slides, the link function in logistic regression (and the Rasch model is a special case) is the logit link  

--

- We still want to work in the linear model framework
- we do this with the log of the odds

$$\log(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}) = \beta_0 + \sum_{n=1}^N \beta_n x_{in}$$
---
class: middle

# Solving for $p_i$

Writing, $\beta_0 + \sum_{n=1}^N \beta_n x_{in}$ as $\theta$ so $$\log(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}) = \theta$$

.pull-left[

1. Exponentiate both sides. 

2. Multiply both sides by ${1-p_i}$  

3. Distribut the left side

4. Add $e^\theta*p_i$ 

5. Factor out $p_i$ on the left 

6. Divide both sides by $1+e^\theta$ 
]
.pull-right[
1. $\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} =e^\theta$

2. $p_i = e^\theta(1-p_i)$

3. $p_i = e^\theta-e^\theta*p_i$

4. $p_i + e^\theta*p_i = e^\theta$

5. $p_i(1+e^\theta)= e^\theta$

6. $p_i = \frac{e^\theta}{1+e^\theta}$

Probability

+ Perhaps the most basic defintion (frequency/long run frequency)  

  + proportion of times an event occurs given a number of trials
  + Often not that simple to interpret  
  + Cannot be outside the range, [0,1]

--

+ `p` is the probability of an event occurring
  

+ `1-p` is the probability of an even not occurring 

--

+ What does it mean to say a coin has a 50% chance of landing heads? Or a student has a 30% chance of answering an item correctly?

--

+ Usually invoking the long run

---

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina=3, fig.width=9, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, figh.height=7, paged.print=FALSE}

flips <- data.frame(result=unlist(lapply(c(1:10000),  function(x)mean(sample(c(0,1), size = x, replace = T)))), trial=c(1:10000))

ggplot(data=flips, aes(x=trial, y=result))+ 
  geom_line() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = .5) +
  ylab("Proportion of heads") +
  xlab("Number of coin flips") +
  ggtitle("Proportion of heads vs Number of coin flips")


```

---

class: middle

# Odds


+ Odds are basically the ratio of an event happening to an event not happening

--

+ Formally `odds = p/(1-p)`

+ If `p = .6`

+ Odds are `1.5 (.6/.4)` - the event (a candidate winning an election) is 1.5 times more likely to happen than not 

--

+ What are the odds if the probability is .5?


---

class: middle


# Log of the odds -logits

+ Take the natural log (ln) of the odds 

+ $log_{e}(odds)$ or $ln(odds)$

+ Most commonly (and in R): $log(odds)$

+ Odds range from $(0, \infty)$ not great for linear modeling

+ log odds range from $(-\infty, \infty)$

---
class: middle

# Formulas for going the other way: logits to probability

1. Exponentiate - $$e^{logit} = e^{log_e(odds)} = odds$$


2. Get the probability $$\frac{odds}{1+odds}$$

## Introducing "Scripts"

+ Scripts are (essentially) RStudio's text editor. **Work in Scripts**. They're saved text that you _can_ edit  
  

+ Code in the console doesn't get saved and you _cannot_  edit  
  
--

+ The primary aim of working in scripts is reproducability, transparency, being able to run code from start-to-finish without intervening    


--
+ Rely on being able to re-run your script as if you have no memory of what you had done before when you return to the script the next day (or whatever)

---

# Running the code in a script

## Creating a new script in RStudio

.pull-left[
1. File > New File > R Script 
  + Or, ctrl+shft+N
  + Or, below file, hit the icon that looks like:
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("createscript.jpg")
```

2. To run a line of code in a script
+ put your cursor on that line, 
+ run it, via ctrl/cmd + enter. 
+ Or the `run` button in the top right of the script
]

--
.pull-right[Make sure it works: 3. Type `1+1` in a script and run it.
  + What happens? Where does it output?

4. There are multiple ways to run more than one line of code at a time
  + Highlight the relevant code, run
  + Or select the various options under "Run"]
--
  
.center[Write two lines of code (such as `1+1` and `2+2`)]

class: middle


## Commenting

*Commenting is essential.* 

+ R will recognize any line after `#` as a comment

For instance:

```{r}
# I ran this to see what would happen

factorial(4)

```

+ Add more comments than you think you need
---


# Vocabulary
          
| R Word   | Translation
|----------|------------------
| Script   | Document containing code to be run
| Console  | Output Window/Printer (but you can also run code here)
| Environment| The place where things you create in R, live (metaphorically)
| Working Directory| The folder where your current R session lives, where output files go
  
---

class: middle

## Working Directory (We'll return to this in more detail later)
+ The notion of the <mark>working directory</mark> isn't unique to R

+ Directories are just folders on your computer with a certain `path`
  + For instance, your `desktop` is a directory
  + A folder within `Documents` is a directory

+ A `working directory` is just where you tell `R` that you'll be working
  + when you load files, it knows to look to a certain folder
  + When you export files, `R` exports automatically to the working directory

---

class: middle

## File paths

+ A path to a Word doc on my desktop looks like: `C:/Users/katzd/Desktop/myfile.docx`

+ A path to a file in a folder called, `thesis` in the `Documents directory` looks like `C:/Users/katzd/Documents/thesis/myfile.docx`

+ But these are long!

+ Instead, we'll tell `R` where to read files from, where to export, etc, via `projects`
---

class: middle 

## File Paths: Getting the Wd...

+ To see the currect working directory, simply run the code `getwd()`

+ To set the working directory `setwd("filepath")` (the filepath has to be in quotes)

+ It's often useful to set the working directory at the top of your script

**via menu options**: Session ➡️ Set Working Directory ➡️ Choose Directory (copy and paste outputted code to the top of your script)

+ Some people don't like this practice: [**Link**](https://whattheyforgot.org/safe-paths.html)

+ Run: `getwd()`

---

.middle[### If you've made any comments or would like to save your current script, please go ahead an do-so now (file ➡️  save ➡️  where you want to save it ➡️  name)]

---

## Creating RStudio Projects
### Projects are an RStudio staple

.pull-left[1. Once open, click File (top left) ➡️  New Project

2. New Directory ➡️  New Project ➡️  Create Project as a Subdirectory of: click `browse`.
  
3. Choose where you'd like to put this session's R work (for instance, on your desktop in a folder called, `ED217B Lab 1`) - or even one level down in a new folder within `ED217B Lab 1`) 

4. `Directory Name` ➡️  Name this R project - `IntroR` (no spaces; It'll make your life easier) ➡️ Create Project.]

# Setting up a nice working directory
--

1. There are various philosophies about setting up your working directory. Within your working directory...  



1. Set up a folder called "scripts" or similar  

--

1. Set up a folder called "data"  

--

1. Set up a folder called "output" or similar  

Finally...time to get our feet wet...

---

# Getting set up.

1. Download the R script `Intro_to_R1.R`

1. Place `Intro_to_R1.R` in your `scripts` subdirectory.

---
## Variable Assignment
1. One of the most fundamental aspects of R (really any language) is assigning `variables` or `objects`, 
  + giving something a name so you can 
  + store it 
  + work with it in R.
  + R uses `<-` (you can also use for Windows: "alt" and "-" or on a Mac: "option" and "-")

2. Now, we can store objects in R and work with the objects!

3. Note, none of this requires an external package, just through `base R`. For a nice base R cheat sheet, [_**Click**_](https://paulvanderlaken.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/base-r-cheetsheat.pdf)

--

4. When we start assigning variables, note what changes in your R session (where do you see the variables go?)

---

class: middle
 
### For instance, run the code below:
```{r echo=TRUE}
x <- 2
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
#What's the value of y?
y <- x+2
```

1. What is in your Global Environment, now?  
2. What was outputted in the console?
3. Now run `x <- 3`. What is the value of x? What is the value of `x+2`
4. Just type `x` and run

---

class: middle 


## The Environment

+ In the right corner, under `Global Environment`, you should now see where R is "storing" `x` and `y` and their values.

+ The environment is also where we'll see what datasets, in R speak, `dataframes` that we have loaded or created, or other objects

+ If you don't assign something to a variable, it won't be stored

---

class: middle

---
  
# R and Packages
+ Think of `packages` as very specialized bundles of software. 
  + They're collections of functions developed by the "community"

--
+ These packages have documentation if they're on `CRAN: The Comprehensive R Archive Network` (and even sometimes if they're not)

--

+ You don't need all the packages!

--
+ Packages add functions to base R

--

+ For instance, the `psych` package is built with tools commonly needed in the social sciences

---
class: middle

## Packages, cont'd
+ When you `install.packages()`, R will search for a package on `CRAN` and download it to your computer (have to be connected to the internet)

+ To see where it's downloaded, run `.libpaths()`

+ Each time you start a new R session, you have to load a package via `library()` but you don't have to install each time


---
## Getting help
+ First and foremost, you can see installed packages in the bottom-right pane:

```{r echo=FALSE, dpi=150}
knitr::include_graphics("packages.jpg")
```

+ Click on a package to see the documentation
---
## Other Help

+ You can also type `?packagename` such as `?dplyr`

+ To get help with a base R function, you can type ?function

+ To get help with a package function, you can type: `?packagename::function` such as `?dplyr::select` where select is a particular function in R.

+ Under the <mark>Help</mark> tab in R studio (next to `Tools` at the top), exists a few resources as well, including "cheat sheets"

+ Also, Google (we'll talk about this more)!

---
# Run the examples in documentation, usually at the bottom of the section to see how something works!

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("doc_examples.jpg")
```

# Operators in R
|Operation|Operator in R |Example|
|---------|------|-------|-------|
|Addition |`+` |`4+3`
|Subtraction|`-`| `4-3`
|Multiplication|`*`| `4*3`
|Exponentiation | `**`| `4**3`
|Division | `/`| `12/4`
|Matrix multiplication|`%*%`| `a %*% b`|

**Challenge: Aside from the matrix multiplication, make sure all of these work in `R`** (use a script!)

---

## Output
+ R `returns a value` in the `console`

+ It'll look like this:
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("output_slides.jpg")
```

***Challenge***: Order of operations: Run `(4+3)*(4-3)` and then `4+3*4-3` in the console (for experimentation). What happens?

### This is one of those necessary evils, so you know how R works
- To select individual elements in a vector, use `[2]` and the numeric position that you would like to extract. 

- For instance, run: `v6 <- v5[c(2,3)]`

- This is also how one may pull out individual columns, rows, or specific rows and columns in a dataframe in R using <mark>base R</mark>

- We can also get descriptives or compute across a vector, or specific vector elements

- Working with datasets or matrices, we can subset rows, columns or both
---
class: middle 

#### Rows: `df[1, ]` (gets just the first row)
#### Columnn `df[,1]` or `df[1]` (gets just the first column)
#### Both `df[1,1]`
#### Can Select multiple `df[1:5, 1:6]` or `df[c(1,3, 8), c(1, 9, 2)]`
