# An Introduction to R: Data Cleaning, Wrangling, Visualizing, and Everything Else
### Daniel Katz

class: middle



# Introduction




+ I'm a fourth year grad student at UCSB

+ Began chipping away at learning R about four years ago

+ It was really frustrating

+ After a major project or two, it became my preferred tool for most things data analysis

+ I don't expect you to be experts after this session, but I hope you know where to start!

### Teaching Philosophy/General Strategy


+ My goal is to get you up and running - doing is the best learning
  
+ I'm going with a `tidyverse` [_**first**_](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/) approach while mixing in foundations that I find unavoidable [_**Click to read more**_](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/)

+ I won't emphasize style/best practices except in a few cases

+ I think it's important to focus on ideas and functions!

+ For more on style/best practices, [_**click here**_](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)

## General Outline
1. Intro: What is R? How should I think about R and Rstudio?

2. Some basic data structures (unavoidable foundation)

3. Data wrangling with the `tidyverse`

4. Data exploration
  + Visualization
  + Descriptive Statistics
  
5. Basic modelling in R

6. Other Help Resources

# What is R?

+ R is a software and scripting language

+ Like any other language it has syntax (for now think, "rules" of language)

+ R comes with a variety of built-in functions

+ R is desiged for statistics, but you can do lots with it 
  + build websites
  + write documents in Latex
  + Create slides for presentations, etc.

---

# R and Packages
+ Think of `packages` as very specialized bundles of software. 
  + They're collections of functions developed by the "community"
  + For a full intro, [_**click here**_](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-packages-guide#what)

+ These packages have documentation if they're on `CRAN: The Comprehensive R Archive Network` (and even sometimes if they're not)  
  
+ You don't need all the packages!

+ For instance, the `psych` package is a built with tools commonly needed in the social sciences
  
--
  
+ We'll be focusing on a suite of packages called the `tidyverse`, which helps with data exploration, cleaning, and visualization
---

## Packages, cont'd
+ When you `install.packages()`, R will search for a package on `CRAN` and download it to your computer

+ To see where it's downloaded, type `.libpaths()` and run this

+ Each time you start a new R session, you have to load a package via `library()` but you don't have to install, each time
---

class: middle

# Installing and Loading Packages 
Installs the package if it's not already installed:

`install.packages("psych")`

Loads the package so I can use the functions in the `psych` package"
`library(psych)`
---

class: middle 


## Installing and loading packages looks like this

`install.packages("psych)`  
`library(psych)`

# Why do I like R?
+ It is quickly becoming the statistical language of choice in academic and non-academic circles  

--
  
+ Fast developing `R Packages` are making tasks more accessible to non-programmers like us
  
--
  
+ R allows for sharing code: we won't cover Github, but please [_**check it out**_](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)
  
--
  
+ R forces us to slow down and think

# It makes really cool data visualizations

## What's a Function?

---


&lt;img src="cyclists.gif" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Other Forms of Functions?
`\(f(x)=sin(\theta)\)` 

`f_angle &lt;- sin(angle)` 


![](r_introslides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.gif)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
## What are some functions we use?
.pull-left[## How about a mean?
Let's say we have a vector, `x`, with five elements: `1,2,3,4,5`    

`x = [1,2,3,4,5]`

`\(mean(x)=\frac{1+2+3+4+5}{5}\)` 

`\(mean(x) = 3\)`]

--
.pull-right[## `R` uses functions:

```r
#Let's make a vector with 
#five elements

x &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5)

mean(x)
```

```
## [1] 3
```
]
---

## There are also other forms of functions we use in computation
+ "Reading in" Data into R so we can explore or model

+ Linear Regression,`lm()` in R

+ Transforming Data in R:

# Open R Studio

1. Once open, click File (top left) &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; New Project &gt;Create Project as a Subdirectory of: click browse.
  
2. Choose where you'd like to put this session's R work. 

3. Go to the first box, `Directory Name` &gt; Name this R project! (no spaces; It'll make your life easier)

4. Create Project.
 
This is specific to R and Rstudio. *Working directories* (think directories = folders) is where this project will look for files, save documents, and results.

--- 


## Let's get Our Hands Dirty (Recommendations)
  
+ The best way to learn R is to use it

+ Even when it's frustratingly slow, use R instead of something else
  
+ There are a lot of resources online to answer questions (Stack Exchange, Stack Overflow, Github)
  
+ Errors are good! Use the error output to guide your thinkingg (and Googling)

+ In other words, "failing fast" is really convenient

# Vocabulary
          
| R Word   | Translation
|----------|------------------
| Script   | Document containing code to be run
| Console  | Output Window/Printer (but you can also run code here)
| Environment| The place where things you create in R, live
| Working Directory| The folder where your current R session lives, where output files go


---

# Open Up Rstudio
1. Find the `View` tab and change your RStudio session to looks like mine
2. Change your R studio Session to look different
3. Find the `Global Environment` (what's in there right now?)
4. Type `4+3` into the `console` and run the code
5. Type `4*3` into a `script` and run the code
---


# Operators in R
|Operation|Operator in R |Example|
|---------|------|-------|-------|
|Addition |`+` |`4+3`
|Subtraction|`-`| `4-3`
|Multiplication|`*`| `4*3`
|Exponentiation | `**`| `4**3`
|Division | `/`| `12/4`
|Matrix multiplication|`%*%`| `a %*% b`|

**Aside from the matrix multiplication, make sure all of these work in `R`** (use a script!)

---


## Working!

`&lt;-`  
is an assignment operator. This assigns some value to a `variable`  
    
For instance:

```r
x &lt;- 2
x
```

```
## [1] 2
```

```r
#What's the value of y?
y &lt;- x+2
```
