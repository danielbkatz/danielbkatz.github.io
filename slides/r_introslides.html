# Introduction




+ I'm a fourth year grad student at UCSB

+ Began chipping away at learning R about four years ago

+ It was really frustrating

+ After a major project or two, it became my preferred tool for most things data analysis

+ I don't expect you to be experts after this session, but I hope you know where to start!

### Teaching Philosophy/General Strategy


+ My goal is to get you up and running - doing is the best learning
  
+ I'm going with a `tidyverse` [_**first**_](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/) approach while mixing in foundations that I find unavoidable [_**Click to read more**_](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/)

+ I won't emphasize style/best practices except in a few cases

+ I think it's important to focus on ideas and functions!

+ For more on style/best practices, [_**click here**_](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)

+ Learning how to trouble shoot is quite important

# What is R?

+ R is a software and scripting language

+ Like any other language it has syntax (for now think, "rules" of language)

+ R comes with a variety of built-in functions

+ R is desiged for statistics, but you can do lots with it 
  + build websites
  + write documents in Latex
  + Create slides for presentations, etc.
---
class: middle
  
# Why do I like R?

+ It is quickly becoming the statistical language of choice in academic and non-academic circles    
--
  
+ Fast developing `R Packages` are making tasks more accessible to non-programmers like us  
--
  
+ R allows for sharing code: we won't cover Github, but please [_**check it out**_](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)  
--
  
+ R forces us to slow down and think  

---

# It makes really cool data visualizations

## What's a Function?

---


&lt;img src="cyclists.gif" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Other Forms of Functions?
`\(f(x)=sin(\theta)\)` 

`f_angle &lt;- sin(angle)` 


![](r_introslides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.gif)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
## What are some functions we use?
.pull-left[## How about a mean?
Let's say we have a vector, `x`, with five elements: `1,2,3,4,5`    

`x = [1,2,3,4,5]`

`\(mean(x)=\frac{1+2+3+4+5}{5}\)` 

`\(mean(x) = 3\)`]

--
.pull-right[## `R` uses functions:

```r
#Let's make a vector with 
#five elements

x &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5)

mean(x)
```

```
## [1] 3
```
]
---

## There are also other forms of functions we use in computation
+ "Reading in" Data into R so we can explore or model

+ Linear Regression,`lm()` in R

+ Transforming Data in R:

# Always Remind Yourself
  
+ The best way to learn R is to use it

+ Even when it's frustratingly slow, use R instead of something else
  
+ There are a lot of resources online to answer questions (Stack Exchange, Stack Overflow, Github)
  
+ Errors are good! Use the error output to guide your thinkingg (and Googling)

+ In other words, "failing fast" is really convenient


---

class: middle


## Introducing "Scripts"

+ Scripts are RStudio's text editor. ***Work in Scripts***. They're saved text that you *can* edit  
  

+ Code in the console doesn't get saved and you *cannot* edit  
  
--

+ The primary aim of working in scripts is reproducability, transparency, being able to run code from start-to-finish without intervening  
  
--
+ Don't rely on saving data, rely on being able to re-run your script as if you have no memory of what you had done before 

---

# Running the code in a script

&lt;img src="run script.jpg" width="1820" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Creating a new script in RStudio

.pull-left[
1. File &gt; New File &gt; R Script 
  + Or, ctrl+shft+N
  + Or, below file, hit the icon that looks like:
&lt;img src="createscript.jpg" width="51" /&gt;

2. To run a line of code in a script, put your cursor on that line, and run it, via ctrl/cmd + enter. Or the `run` button in the top right of the script
]

--
.pull-right[3. Type `1+1` in a script and run it.
  + What happens? Where does it output?

4. There are multiple ways to run more than one line of code at a time
  + Highlight the relevant code, run
  + Or select the various options under "Run"]

--

.center[**Challenge** Figure out how to run a line of code in the console!]

---


class: middle


## Commenting


+ Commenting is essential to workflow. You may not remember why or what you were thinking or doing when looking at old code. 

+ R will recognize any line after `#` as a comment

For instance:


```r
# I ran this to see what would happen

factorial(4)
```

```
## [1] 24
```

+ I recommend taking notes in an R script this way! 
---


# Vocabulary
          
| R Word   | Translation
|----------|------------------
| Script   | Document containing code to be run
| Console  | Output Window/Printer (but you can also run code here)
| Environment| The place where things you create in R, live
| Working Directory| The folder where your current R session lives, where output files go
  
---

class: middle

## working Directory (We'll return to this in more detail later)
+ The notion of the &lt;mark&gt;working directory&lt;/mark&gt; isn't unique to R

+ Directories are just folders on your computer with a certain `path`
  + For instance, your `desktop` is a directory
  + A folder within `Documents` is a directory

+ A `working directory` is just where you tell `R` that you'll be working
  + when you load files, it knows to look to a certain folder
  + When you export files, `R` exports automatically to the working directory]

---
## File paths

.pull-left[+ A path to a Word doc on my desktop looks like: "C:/Users/katzd/Desktop/myfile.docx".

+ A path to a file in a folder called, `thesis` in the `Documents directory` looks like "C:/Users/katzd/Documents/thesis/myfile.docx"

+ But these are long!]

.pull-right[+ Instead, we'll tell `R` where to read files from, where to export, etc, via `projects`

+ If I make the folder, `thesis` my working directory, then you won't need to type, the whole path, just the name of the document or &lt;mark&gt;subdirectory&lt;/mark&gt; plus folder 

+ If I have a folder called, `analysis` in `thesis`, and thesis is my working directory the path will be "analysis/filename.ext".

+ To see the currect working directory, simply run the code `getwd()`

+ To set the working directory setwd("filepath") (the filepath has to be in quotes)]

.center[###If you've made any comments or would like to save your current script, go ahead an do-so now (file &gt; save &gt; where you want to save it &gt; name)]

---

## Creating RStudio Projects
### Projects are an RStudio work unit, (but, not required)

.pull-left[1. Once open, click File (top left) &gt; New Project

2. New Directory &gt; New Project &gt; Create Project as a Subdirectory of: click `browse`.
  
3. Choose where you'd like to put this session's R work (for instance, on your desktop. 

4. Go to the first box, `Directory Name` &gt; Name this R project - `IntroR` (no spaces; It'll make your life easier)

5. Create Project.]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="newproject.jpg" width="800px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]
---

class: middle

## Let's get setup for the workshop!
1. In your project, create a new script to have at the ready.
2. Save the script as `introscript`.
3. Use a command to check your working directory.
4. Write a comment that "this is the first R work we'll do in the R workshop"
5. Find the `View` tab and change your RStudio session so it shows only the console
6. Change your R studio Session to look like it did before
7. Find the `Global Environment` (what's in there right now?)


---
  
# R and Packages
+ Think of `packages` as very specialized bundles of software. 
  + They're collections of functions developed by the "community"
  + For a full intro, [_**click here**_](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-packages-guide#what)

+ These packages have documentation if they're on `CRAN: The Comprehensive R Archive Network` (and even sometimes if they're not)  
  
+ You don't need all the packages!

+ Packages add functions to base R

+ For instance, the `psych` package is a built with tools commonly needed in the social sciences
---
class: middle

## Packages, cont'd
+ When you `install.packages()`, R will search for a package on `CRAN` and download it to your computer

+ To see where it's downloaded, type `.libpaths()` and run this

+ Each time you start a new R session, you have to load a package via `library()` but you don't have to install, each time
---

class: middle

# Installing and Loading Packages 
Installs the package if it's not already installed:

`install.packages("psych")`

Loads the package so I can use the functions in the `psych` package"
`library(psych)`
---

class: middle 


## Installing and loading packages looks like this (note the quotes)

```r
install.packages("psych")  
library(psych)
```
---

class: middle

## Let's Install and Load the tidyverse


```r
install.packages("tidyverse")  
library(tidyverse)
```

  
---
## why the tidyverse?

The [_**tidyverse**_](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) is a suite of packages used to make data wrangling/cleaning, exploration, and, ultimately, modelling
  
  
&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Package &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Description &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; dplyr &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for creating common, easy to use and remember verbs for basic data handling tasks &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; ggplot2 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for data visualization &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; tidyr &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for creating `tidy` data &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; readr &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for reading in 'rectangular' data of different formats &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; purrr &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for really working with lots of data easily (for cleaning, computing variables, etc.) &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; tibble &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; to make dealing with dataframes even easier. Dataframes will become tibbles in R &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; stringr &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for working with strings and doing a bit of text mining &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; forcats &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for handling factors in R &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

# Operators in R
|Operation|Operator in R |Example|
|---------|------|-------|-------|
|Addition |`+` |`4+3`
|Subtraction|`-`| `4-3`
|Multiplication|`*`| `4*3`
|Exponentiation | `**`| `4**3`
|Division | `/`| `12/4`
|Matrix multiplication|`%*%`| `a %*% b`|

**Aside from the matrix multiplication, make sure all of these work in `R`** (use a script!)

---

## Output
+ R `returns a value` in the `console`

+ It'll look like this:
&lt;img src="output_slides.jpg" width="1809" /&gt;

***Challenge***: Order of operations: Run `(4+3)*(4-3)` and then `4+3*4-3` in the console (for experimentation). What happens?

---
## Variable Assignment
1. One of the most fundamental aspects of R (really any language) assigning `variables` or `objects`, giving something a name so you can store it and work with it in R.
  + R uses `&lt;-` (shortcut for Windows: "alt" and "-" or in Mac: "option" and "-")

2. Now, we can store objects in R and work with the objects!

3. Note, none of this requires an external package, just through `base R`. For a nice base R cheat sheet, [_**Click**_](https://paulvanderlaken.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/base-r-cheetsheat.pdf)

--
 
For instance, run the code below:

```r
x &lt;- 2
```


```r
#What's the value of y?
y &lt;- x+2
```

1. What is in your Global Environment, now?
2. What was outputted in the console?

--
**Outputting the value of a variable requires using `print(x)`, or just `x`

---

class: middle 


## The Environment

+ In the right corner, under `Global Environment`, you should now see where R is "storing" `x` and `y` and their values.

+ The environment is also where we'll see what datasets, in R speak, `dataframes` that we have loaded or created, or other objects that we've assigned to variables


+If you don't assign something to a variable, it won't be stored
---
  

## Run the code below in a script

`x + y`

`x*y`

`x==y`

What happens?
--


```r
x + y
```

```
## [1] 6
```

```r
x*y
```

```
## [1] 8
```

```r
x==y
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

---
## Boolean/Logical Operators!

+ If you notice, R `x==y` yields, `FALSE`
+ `==` is a different type of operator

|Operation|Operator in R |Example|
|---------|------|-------|-------|
|Equality/Are they Equal? |`==` |`x==y`
|Not Equal |`!=` |`x!=y`
|Greater than or equal|`&gt;=`| `x &gt;= y`
|Less than or equal to|`&lt;=`| `x &lt;= y`
|Greater than|`&gt;`| `x &gt; y`
|Less than |`&lt;`| `x &lt; y`
|Or |  `|` | `x|y`
|And | `&amp;`| `x &amp; y`

---

## Data Structures
For individual values or vectors, R has a number of data types (not different than SPSS). We have a few ways of checking (for instance, numeric, character, factor, etc):


```r
# this will work on vectors as well
class(x)
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

```r
is.numeric(x)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
is.character(x)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

```r
isTRUE(x&lt;2)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```
---
Class: Middle

## what's a Vector?
+ In R, it's basically anything that has more than one `element` in it.

+ It's just like a vector in math (row vector, column vector)

+ R does think in matrices

+ Instead of doing things one at a time, it operates on entire rows, columns, dataframes, lists, (arrays in general)


```r
v1 &lt;- c(1, 3, 8, 9, 10**8)
v1
```

```
## [1] 1e+00 3e+00 8e+00 9e+00 1e+08
```

---
## Check your Understanding

Run the following code:

`v2 &lt;- c("hello", "world", 4, 5)`

`v2`

`class(v2)`

**Challenge** 
1. What do you think `c()` does? (concat...)  

2. What &lt;mark&gt;`class`&lt;/mark&gt; is `v2`?  

3. Strings, or in R speak, objects of class `character`, need to have double or single quotes around them. Any intuition as to why?  


---

## Check for Understanding

1. Run the following code:

`v3 &lt;- c(1:5)`  
`v4 &lt;- c(6:10)`    
`v5 &lt;- v3+v4 `  
`v5`   

2. What does the `:` operator do?

3. what class is `newvector`?

--


```r
v3 &lt;- c(1:5)
v4 &lt;- c(6:10)
v5 &lt;- v3+v4
v5
```

```
## [1]  7  9 11 13 15
```

class: middle

### This is one of those necessary evils, so you know how R works
- To select individual elements, use `[2]` and the numeric position that you would like to extract. 

- For instance, run: `v6 &lt;- v5[c(2,3)]`

- This is also how one may pull out individual columns, rows, or specific rows and columns in a dataframe in R using &lt;mark&gt;base R&lt;/mark&gt;

- We can also get descriptives or compute across a vector, or specific vector elements

---

## How to Operate on Vectors (this is also true for dataframes)

+ Everything below are base R commands using base R functions

`sum(v5)`  
**`sum(v5[c(2,3)])`**  

`mean(v5)`  
`sd(v5)`  
`range(v5)`  
**`summary(v5)`**

```
## [1] 20
```

```
## [1] 11
```

```
## [1] 3.162278
