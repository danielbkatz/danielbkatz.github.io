# Introduction




+ I'm a fourth year grad student at UCSB

+ Began chipping away at learning R about four years ago

+ It was really frustrating

+ After a major project or two, it became my preferred tool for most things data analysis

### Teaching Philosophy/General Strategy


+ My goal is to get you up and running - doing is the best learning

+ Provide you with some quality resources for continuing to learn via links like [_**this**_](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/r/info)
  
+ I'm going with a `tidyverse` [_**first**_](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/) approach while mixing in foundations that I find unavoidable [_**Click to read more**_](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/)

# What is R?

+ R is a software and scripting language  
  

+ Like any other language it has syntax (for now think, "rules" of language)  
  

+ R comes with a variety of built-in functions  
  
  
+ R is desiged for statistics, but you can do lots with it 
  + build websites
  + write documents in Latex
  + Create slides for presentations, etc.
---
class: middle
  
# Why do I like R?

+ It is quickly becoming the statistical language of choice in academic and non-academic circles    

--
  
+ Fast developing `R Packages` are making tasks more accessible to non-programmers like us  


--
  
+ R allows for sharing code: we won't cover Github, but please [_**check it out**_](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)  

--
  
+ R forces us to slow down and think  


---

# It makes really cool data visualizations

## What's a Function?

---


&lt;img src="cyclists.gif" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Other Forms of Functions?
`\(f(x)=sin(\theta)\)` 

`f_angle &lt;- sin(angle)` 


![](r_introslides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.gif)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
## What are some functions we use?
.pull-left[## How about a mean?
Let's say we have a vector, `x`, with five elements: `1,2,3,4,5`    

`x = [1,2,3,4,5]`

`\(mean(x)=\frac{1+2+3+4+5}{5}\)` 

`\(mean(x) = 3\)`]

--
.pull-right[## `R` uses functions:

```r
#Let's make a vector with 
#five elements

x &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5)

mean(x)
```

```
## [1] 3
```
]
---

class: middle

## Some of the language

.pull-left[
1. What goes in the parentheses of a function, such as `mean(x)` is called an &lt;mark&gt;argument&lt;/mark&gt;

1. R functions often take more than one argument

1. &lt;mark&gt;Code completion&lt;/mark&gt;: you can see what arguments a function takes as you start typing. R is making suggestions. 

1. Hit tab to select these options!]
--

.pull-right[
1. `ggplot()` is a function, it performs some operation

1. It takes several arguments such as `ggplot(data=df, aes(x=xvar, y=yvar))`

1. Note: `df` is often R standin speak for a hypothetical `dataframe`, an R word for dataset

1. Argument type and number varies from function-to-function
]

---

class: middle

# Syntax, Continued 

+ When you see that an argument has an option with an equal sign, it usually means order doesn't matter as long as you type the argument name first

+ For instance to perform linear regression I can type `lm(data=df, outcome~var1+var2)` Or `lm(outcome~var1+var2, df)`

+ You need commas between arguments

+ Make sure your parentheses match/are closed

+ R is case sensitive. So `var1` is different from `Var1`
---

class: middle 

## There are also other forms of functions we use in computation
+ "Reading in" Data into R so we can explore or model

+ Linear Regression,`lm()` in R

+ Transforming Data in R:

# Always Remind Yourself
  
+ The best way to learn R is to use it

+ Even when it's frustratingly slow, use R instead of something else
  
+ Errors are good! Use the error output to guide your thinking (and Googling)

+ In other words, "failing fast" is really convenient:
  + Run code, change it until it breaks, figure out why it breaks
  + Run example code, break it up into parts



---

class: middle


## Introducing "Scripts"

+ Scripts are RStudio's text editor. **Work in Scripts**. They're saved text that you _can_ edit  
  

+ Code in the console doesn't get saved and you _cannot_ edit  
  
--

+ The primary aim of working in scripts is reproducability, transparency, being able to run code from start-to-finish without intervening    


--
+ Don't rely on saving data, rely on being able to re-run your script as if you have no memory of what you had done before 

---

# Running the code in a script

1. File &gt; New File &gt; R Script 
  + Or, ctrl+shft+N

&lt;img src="createscript.jpg" width="51" /&gt;

2. To run a line of code in a script
+ put your cursor on that line, 
+ run it, via ctrl/cmd + enter. 
+ Or the `run` button in the top right of the script
]

--
.pull-right[Make sure it works: 3. Type `1+1` in a script and run it.
  + What happens? Where does it output?

4. There are multiple ways to run more than one line of code at a time
  + Highlight the relevant code, run
  + Or select the various options under "Run"]

class: middle


## Commenting

*Commenting is essential.* 

+ R will recognize any line after `#` as a comment

For instance:


```r
# I ran this to see what would happen

factorial(4)
```

```
## [1] 24
```

+ I recommend taking notes in an R script for this workshop! 
---


# Vocabulary
          
| R Word   | Translation
|----------|------------------
| Script   | Document containing code to be run
| Console  | Output Window/Printer (but you can also run code here)
| Environment| The place where things you create in R, live
| Working Directory| The folder where your current R session lives, where output files go
  
---

class: middle

## Working Directory (We'll return to this in more detail later)
+ The notion of the &lt;mark&gt;working directory&lt;/mark&gt; isn't unique to R

+ Directories are just folders on your computer with a certain `path`
  + For instance, your `desktop` is a directory
  + A folder within `Documents` is a directory

+ A `working directory` is just where you tell `R` that you'll be working
  + when you load files, it knows to look to a certain folder
  + When you export files, `R` exports automatically to the working directory

---

class: middle

## File paths

+ A path to a Word doc on my desktop looks like: `C:/Users/katzd/Desktop/myfile.docx`

+ A path to a file in a folder called, `thesis` in the `Documents directory` looks like `C:/Users/katzd/Documents/thesis/myfile.docx`

+ But these are long!

+ Instead, we'll tell `R` where to read files from, where to export, etc, via `projects`
---

class: middle

## File Paths Continued...Example

+ I make the folder, `thesis`, my working directory, with `analysis.csv` in it.

+ You won't need to type the whole path, just the name of the document or &lt;mark&gt;subdirectory&lt;/mark&gt; plus file 

+ If I have a folder called, `analysis` in `thesis` directory the path will be &lt;mark&gt;analysis/filename.ext&lt;/mark&gt;.
---
class: middle 

## File Paths: Getting the Wd...

+ To see the currect working directory, simply run the code `getwd()`

+ To set the working directory `setwd("filepath")` (the filepath has to be in quotes)

+ It's often useful to set the working directory at the top of your script

**via menu options**: Session ➡️ Set Working Directory ➡️ Choose Directory (copy and paste outputted code to the top of your script)

+ Some people don't like this practice: [**Link**](https://whattheyforgot.org/safe-paths.html)

+ Run: `getwd()`

---

.middle[### If you've made any comments or would like to save your current script, please go ahead an do-so now (file ➡️  save ➡️  where you want to save it ➡️  name)]

---

## Creating RStudio Projects
### Projects are an RStudio work unit, (but, not required)

.pull-left[1. Once open, click File (top left) ➡️  New Project

2. New Directory ➡️  New Project ➡️  Create Project as a Subdirectory of: click `browse`.
  
3. Choose where you'd like to put this session's R work (for instance, on your desktop in a folder called, `Rworkshop`). 

4. `Directory Name` ➡️  Name this R project - `IntroR` (no spaces; It'll make your life easier) ➡️ Create Project.]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="newproject.jpg" width="800px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]
---

class: middle

## Let's get setup for the workshop!
1. In your project, create a new script to have at the ready. 

2. Save the script as `introscript`. 

3. Use a command to check your working directory. [_Hint_](http://www.dbkatz.com/slides/r_introslides.html#38).

4. Write a comment:"this is the first R work we'll do in the R workshop"

5. Find the `View` tab and change your RStudio session so it shows only the console

6. Change your R studio Session to look like it did before

7. Find the `Global Environment` (what's in there right now?)

# R and Packages
+ Think of `packages` as very specialized bundles of software. 
  + They're collections of functions developed by the "community"
  + For a full intro, [_**click here**_](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-packages-guide#what)

--
+ These packages have documentation if they're on `CRAN: The Comprehensive R Archive Network` (and even sometimes if they're not)

--

+ You don't need all the packages!

--
+ Packages add functions to base R

--

+ For instance, the `psych` package is built with tools commonly needed in the social sciences

---
class: middle

## Packages, cont'd
+ When you `install.packages()`, R will search for a package on `CRAN` and download it to your computer (have to be connected to the internet)

+ To see where it's downloaded, run `.libpaths()`

+ Each time you start a new R session, you have to load a package via `library()` but you don't have to install each time
---

class: middle

# Installing and Loading Packages 
Installs the package if it's not already installed:

`install.packages("psych")`

Loads the package so I can use the functions in the `psych` package"
`library(psych)`
---

class: middle 


## Installing and loading packages looks like this (note the quotes)

```r
# note the quotes
install.packages("psych")  
library(psych)
```
---

class: middle

## Let's Install and Load the tidyverse


```r
install.packages("tidyverse")  
```
## Load the tidyverse


```r
library(tidyverse)
```

---
## Getting help
+ First and foremost, you can see installed packages in the bottom-right pane:

&lt;img src="packages.jpg" width="868" /&gt;

+ Click on a package to see the documentation
---
## Other Help

+ You can also type `?packagename` such as `?dplyr`

+ To get help with a base R function, you can type ?function

+ To get help with a package function, you can type: `?packagename::function` such as `?dplyr::select` where select is a particular function in R.

+ Under the &lt;mark&gt;Help&lt;/mark&gt; tab in R studio (next to `Tools` at the top), exists a few resources as well, including "cheat sheets"

+ Also, Google (we'll talk about this more)!

---
# Run the examples in documentation, usually at the bottom of the section to see how something works!

&lt;img src="doc_examples.jpg" width="1569" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
## why the tidyverse?

The [_**tidyverse**_](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) is a suite of packages used to make data wrangling/cleaning, exploration, and, ultimately, modelling easier
  
  
&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Package &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Description &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; dplyr &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for creating common, easy to use and remember verbs for basic data handling tasks &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; ggplot2 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for data visualization &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; tidyr &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for creating `tidy` data &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; readr &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for reading in 'rectangular' data of different formats &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; purrr &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for really working with lots of data easily (for cleaning, computing variables, etc.) &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; tibble &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; to make dealing with dataframes even easier. Dataframes will become tibbles in R &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; stringr &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for working with strings and doing a bit of text mining &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; forcats &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for handling factors in R &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

# Operators in R
|Operation|Operator in R |Example|
|---------|------|-------|-------|
|Addition |`+` |`4+3`
|Subtraction|`-`| `4-3`
|Multiplication|`*`| `4*3`
|Exponentiation | `**`| `4**3`
|Division | `/`| `12/4`
|Matrix multiplication|`%*%`| `a %*% b`|

**Challenge: Aside from the matrix multiplication, make sure all of these work in `R`** (use a script!)

---

## Output
+ R `returns a value` in the `console`

+ It'll look like this:
&lt;img src="output_slides.jpg" width="1809" /&gt;

***Challenge***: Order of operations: Run `(4+3)*(4-3)` and then `4+3*4-3` in the console (for experimentation). What happens?

---
## Variable Assignment
1. One of the most fundamental aspects of R (really any language) is assigning `variables` or `objects`, 
  + giving something a name so you can 
  + store it 
  + work with it in R.
  + R uses `&lt;-` (you can also use for Windows: "alt" and "-" or on a Mac: "option" and "-")

2. Now, we can store objects in R and work with the objects!

3. Note, none of this requires an external package, just through `base R`. For a nice base R cheat sheet, [_**Click**_](https://paulvanderlaken.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/base-r-cheetsheat.pdf)

--

4. When we start assigning variables, note what changes in your R session (where do you see the variables go?)

---
class: middle
 
### For instance, run the code below:

```r
x &lt;- 2
```


```r
#What's the value of y?
y &lt;- x+2
```

1. What is in your Global Environment, now?  
2. What was outputted in the console?
3. Now run `x &lt;- 3`. What is the value of x? What is the value of `x+2`
4. Just type `x` and run

---

class: middle 


## The Environment

+ In the right corner, under `Global Environment`, you should now see where R is "storing" `x` and `y` and their values.

+ The environment is also where we'll see what datasets, in R speak, `dataframes` that we have loaded or created, or other objects

+ If you don't assign something to a variable, it won't be stored
---
  

## Run the code below in a script

`x + y`

`x*y`

`x==y`

What happens?

--


```r
x + y
```

```
## [1] 6
```

```r
x*y
```

```
## [1] 8
```

```r
x==y
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

---
## Boolean/Logical Operators!

+ `x==y` yields, `FALSE`: `==` is a different type of operator

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Operation &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Operator &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Example &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Equality; Are they equal? &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; == &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; x==y &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Not Equal &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; != &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; x!=y &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Greater then or equal &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; &amp;gt;= &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; x&amp;gt;=y &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Less than or equal &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; &amp;lt;= &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; x&amp;lt;=y &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Greater than &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; x&amp;gt;y &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Less than &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; &amp;lt; &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; X,y &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Or &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; | &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; x|y &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; And &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; x &amp;amp; y &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
---

## Data Structures
For individual values or vectors, R has a number of data types (not different than SPSS). We have a few ways of checking (for instance, numeric, character, factor, etc): 

`class(x)` returns the data structure (such as numeric, integer, character, factor)

Not exhaustive of all possible:

```r
# this will work on vectors as well. 
class(x)
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

```r
str(x)
```

```
##  num 2
```

```r
is.numeric(x)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
is.character(x)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

Class: Middle

## what's a Vector?
+ In R, it's basically anything that has more than one `element` in it.

+ It's just like a vector in math (row vector, column vector)

+ R does think in matrices

+ Instead of doing things one at a time, it operates on entire rows, columns, dataframes, lists, (arrays in general)
--
## **Run:**

```r
v1 &lt;- c(1, 3, 8, 9, 10*8)
v1
```

```
## [1]  1  3  8  9 80
```

---
## Check for Understanding (classes of vectors)

Run the following code:

`v2 &lt;- c("hello", "world", 4, 5)`

`v2`

`class(v2)`

**Challenge** 
1. What do you think `c()` does?  

2. What &lt;mark&gt;`class`&lt;/mark&gt; is `v2`?  

3. Strings, or in R speak, objects of class `character`, need to have double or single quotes around them. Any intuition as to why?  


---

## Check for Understanding

1. Run the following code:

`v3 &lt;- c(1:5)`  
`v4 &lt;- c(6:10)`    
`v5 &lt;- v3+v4 `  
`v5`   

2. What does the `:` operator do?

3. what class is `v5`?

--
R is vectorized: it operates on entire vectors at a time

```r
v3 &lt;- c(1:5)
v4 &lt;- c(6:10)
v5 &lt;- v3+v4
v5
```

```
## [1]  7  9 11 13 15
```

```r
class(v5)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

class: middle

### This is one of those necessary evils, so you know how R works
- To select individual elements in a vector, use `[2]` and the numeric position that you would like to extract. 

- For instance, run: `v6 &lt;- v5[c(2,3)]`

- This is also how one may pull out individual columns, rows, or specific rows and columns in a dataframe in R using &lt;mark&gt;base R&lt;/mark&gt;

- We can also get descriptives or compute across a vector, or specific vector elements

- Working with datasets or matrices, we can subset rows, columns or both
---

#### Rows: `df[1, ]` (gets just the first row)
#### Columnn `df[,1]` or `df[1]` (gets just the first column)
#### Both `df[1,1]`
#### Can Select multiple `df[1:5, 1:6]` or `df[c(1,3, 8), c(1, 9, 2)]`

### But the `tidyvese` is going to make our lives easier

## Important points from part 1

1. Work in scripts.

2. R comes with a base set of functions.

3. R has data structures and types including mathematical/numerical operators and boolean/logical operators.

4. You can always use `class()` or `str()` to figure out the data-type of a &lt;mark&gt;vector&lt;/mark&gt;.

5. To save variables in R, use an assignment operator.

6. Packages are external software that we can download to R.

7. Within R, there are various ways to get help.
