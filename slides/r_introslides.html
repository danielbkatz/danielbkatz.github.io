# Introduction




+ I'm a fourth year grad student at UCSB

+ Began chipping away at learning R about four years ago

+ It was really frustrating

+ After a major project or two, it became my preferred tool for most things data analysis

+ I don't expect you to be experts after this session, but I hope you know where to start!

+ Always remember that `R` is case sensitive, capitalization matters

### Teaching Philosophy/General Strategy


+ My goal is to get you up and running - doing is the best learning
  
+ I'm going with a `tidyverse` [_**first**_](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/) approach while mixing in foundations that I find unavoidable [_**Click to read more**_](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/)

+ I won't emphasize style/best practices except in a few cases

+ I think it's important to focus on ideas and functions!

+ For more on style/best practices, [_**click here**_](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)

---

## General Outline
1. Intro: What is R? How should I think about R and Rstudio?

2. Some basic data structures (unavoidable foundation)

3. Data wrangling with the `tidyverse`

4. Data exploration
  + Visualization
  + Descriptive Statistics
  
5. Basic modelling in R

6. Other Help Resources

# What is R?

+ R is a software and scripting language

+ Like any other language it has syntax (for now think, "rules" of language)

+ R comes with a variety of built-in functions

+ R is desiged for statistics, but you can do lots with it 
  + build websites
  + write documents in Latex
  + Create slides for presentations, etc.

---

# R and Packages
+ Think of `packages` as very specialized bundles of software. 
  + They're collections of functions developed by the "community"
  + For a full intro, [_**click here**_](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-packages-guide#what)

+ These packages have documentation if they're on `CRAN: The Comprehensive R Archive Network` (and even sometimes if they're not)  
  
+ You don't need all the packages!

+ For instance, the `psych` package is a built with tools commonly needed in the social sciences
  
---
## why the tidyverse?

The [_**tidyverse**_](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) is a suite of packages used to make data wrangling/cleaning, exploration, and, ultimately, modelling
  
  
&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Package &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Description &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; dplyr &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for creating common, easy to use and remember verbs for basic data handling tasks &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; ggplot2 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for data visualization &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; tidyr &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for creating `tidy` data &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; readr &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for reading in 'rectangular' data of different formats &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; purrr &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for really working with lots of data easily (for cleaning, computing variables, etc.) &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; tibble &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; to make dealing with dataframes even easier. Dataframes will become tibbles in R &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; stringr &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for working with strings and doing a bit of text mining &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; forcats &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; for handling factors in R &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

## Packages, cont'd
+ When you `install.packages()`, R will search for a package on `CRAN` and download it to your computer

+ To see where it's downloaded, type `.libpaths()` and run this

+ Each time you start a new R session, you have to load a package via `library()` but you don't have to install, each time
---

class: middle

# Installing and Loading Packages 
Installs the package if it's not already installed:

`install.packages("psych")`

Loads the package so I can use the functions in the `psych` package"
`library(psych)`
---

class: middle 


## Installing and loading packages looks like this (note the quotes)

`install.packages("psych")`  
`library(psych)`

# Why do I like R?
+ It is quickly becoming the statistical language of choice in academic and non-academic circles  

--
  
+ Fast developing `R Packages` are making tasks more accessible to non-programmers like us
  
--
  
+ R allows for sharing code: we won't cover Github, but please [_**check it out**_](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)
  
--
  
+ R forces us to slow down and think

---

# It makes really cool data visualizations

## What's a Function?

---


&lt;img src="cyclists.gif" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Other Forms of Functions?
`\(f(x)=sin(\theta)\)` 

`f_angle &lt;- sin(angle)` 


![](r_introslides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.gif)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
## What are some functions we use?
.pull-left[## How about a mean?
Let's say we have a vector, `x`, with five elements: `1,2,3,4,5`    

`x = [1,2,3,4,5]`

`\(mean(x)=\frac{1+2+3+4+5}{5}\)` 

`\(mean(x) = 3\)`]

--
.pull-right[## `R` uses functions:

```r
#Let's make a vector with 
#five elements

x &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5)

mean(x)
```

```
## [1] 3
```
]
---

## There are also other forms of functions we use in computation
+ "Reading in" Data into R so we can explore or model

+ Linear Regression,`lm()` in R

+ Transforming Data in R:

# Always Remind Yourself
  
+ The best way to learn R is to use it

+ Even when it's frustratingly slow, use R instead of something else
  
+ There are a lot of resources online to answer questions (Stack Exchange, Stack Overflow, Github)
  
+ Errors are good! Use the error output to guide your thinkingg (and Googling)

+ In other words, "failing fast" is really convenient

## Open R Studio

1. Once open, click File (top left) &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; New Project &gt;Create Project as a Subdirectory of: click browse.
  
2. Choose where you'd like to put this session's R work. 

3. Go to the first box, `Directory Name` &gt; Name this R project! (no spaces; It'll make your life easier)

4. Create Project.

## Creating a "Script"

+ Scripts are RStudio's text editor. ***Work in Scripts***. They're saved text.  
  
+ Code in the console doesn't get saved 
  
+ The primary aim of working in scripts in being able to re-run your code
  
+ Don't rely on saving saved data, rely on being able to re-run your script as if you have no memory of what you had done before
---

## Creating a new script
In R studio, in the Project you created...
1. File &gt; New File &gt; R Script 
  + Or, ctrl+shft+N
  + Or, below file, hit the icon that looks like: 
&lt;img src="createscript.jpg" width="51" /&gt;
2. Save your script (File &gt; Save)

3. Make sure it's saved in your project's directory

4. To run a line of code in a script, put your cursor on that line, and run it, via ctrl/cmd + enter. Or the `run` button in the top right of the script

5. There are multiple ways to run more than one line of code at a time
  + Highlight the relevant code, run
  + Or select the various options under "Run"

**Challenge** Figure out how to run a line of code in the console!
---

# Vocabulary
          
| R Word   | Translation
|----------|------------------
| Script   | Document containing code to be run
| Console  | Output Window/Printer (but you can also run code here)
| Environment| The place where things you create in R, live
| Working Directory| The folder where your current R session lives, where output files go

---

class: middle


# Open Up Rstudio
1. Find the `View` tab and change your RStudio session so it shows only the console
2. Change your R studio Session to look like it did before
3. Find the `Global Environment` (what's in there right now?)

---


# Operators in R
|Operation|Operator in R |Example|
|---------|------|-------|-------|
|Addition |`+` |`4+3`
|Subtraction|`-`| `4-3`
|Multiplication|`*`| `4*3`
|Exponentiation | `**`| `4**3`
|Division | `/`| `12/4`
|Matrix multiplication|`%*%`| `a %*% b`|

**Aside from the matrix multiplication, make sure all of these work in `R`** (use a script!)

---

class: middle


## Commenting

+ Commenting is essential to workflow. You may not remember why or what you were thinking or doing when looking at old code. 

+ R will recognize any line after `#` as a comment

For instance:


```r
# I ran this to see what would happen

factorial(4)
```

```
## [1] 24
```

+ I recommend taking notes in an R script this way! 
  + Or open a text file (File &gt; Text File). 
  + This won't run code, you can just take notes right in R studio
---
## Output
+ R `returns a value` in the `console`

+ It'll look like this:
&lt;img src="output_slides.jpg" width="1809" /&gt;

***Challenge***: Order of operations: Run `(4+3)*(4-3)` and then `4+3*4-3` in the console (for experimentation). What happens?

---
## Variable Assignment
1. One of the most fundamental aspects of R (really any language) assigning `variables` or `objects`, giving something a name so you can store it and work with it in R.
  + R uses `&lt;-` (shortcut for Windows: "alt" and "-" or in Mac: "option" and "-")

2. Now, we can store objects in R and work with the objects!

3. Note, none of this requires an external package, just through `base R`. For a nice base R cheat sheet, [_**Click**_](https://paulvanderlaken.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/base-r-cheetsheat.pdf)

--
 
For instance, run the code below:

```r
x &lt;- 2
```


```r
#What's the value of y?
y &lt;- x+2
```
---

class: middle 


## The Environment

+ In the right corner, under `Environment`, you should now see where R is "storing" what `x` and `y` and theire values.

+ The environment is also where we'll see what datasets, in R speak, `dataframes` that we have loaded or created, or other objects that we've assigned to variables


+If you don't assign something to a variable, it won't be stored
---
  

## Run the code below in a script

`x + y`

`x*y`

`x==y`

What happens?
--


```r
x + y
```

```
## [1] 6
```

```r
x*y
```

```
## [1] 8
```

```r
x==y
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

---
## Boolean Operators!

+ If you notice, R `x==y` yields, `FALSE`
+ `==` is a different type of operator

|Operation|Operator in R |Example|
|---------|------|-------|-------|
|Equality/Are they Equal? |`==` |`x==y`
|Not Equal |`!=` |`x!=y`
|Greater than or equal|`&gt;=`| `x &gt;= y`
|Less than or equal to|`&lt;=`| `x &lt;= y`
|Or | `|`| `x|y`
|And | `&amp;`| `x &amp; y`

---

## Data Structures
For individual values or vectors, R has a number of data types (not different than SPSS). We have a few ways of checking (for instance, numeric, character, factor, etc):


```r
# this will work on vectors as well
class(x)
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

```r
is.numeric(x)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
is.character(x)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

```r
isTRUE(x&lt;2)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```
---
Class: Middle

## what's a Vector?
+ In R, it's basically anything that has more than one `element` in it.

+ It's just like a vector in math


```r
vector1 &lt;- c(1, 3, 8, 9, 10**8)
vector1
```

```
## [1] 1e+00 3e+00 8e+00 9e+00 1e+08
```

---
## Check your Understanding

Run the following code:

`thisvector &lt;- c("hello", "world", 4, 5)`

`thisvector`

`class(thisvector)`

**Challenge** 
1. What do you think `c()` does? (concat...)  

2. What `class` is `thisvector`?  

3. Strings, or in R speak, objects of class `character`, need to have double or single quotes around them. Any intuition why?  


---

## Check your Understanding

Run the following code:

`newvector &lt;- c(1:5)`  
`extravector &lt;- c(6:10)`    
`combinedvector &lt;- newvector+extravector`   
`combinedvector`   

2. What does the `:` operator do?

3. what class is `newvector`?

--


```r
newvector &lt;- c(1:5)
extravector &lt;- c(6:10)
combinedvector &lt;- newvector+extravector

combinedvector
```

```
## [1]  7  9 11 13 15
```

---
### This is one of those necessary evils, so you know how R works
- To select individual elements, use `[2]` and the numeric position that you would like to extract. 

- For instance, run: `new2 &lt;- newvector[c(2,3)]`

- This is also how one may pull out individual columns, rows, or specific rows and columns in a dataframe in R

- We can also get descriptives or compute across a vector, or specific vector elements

---

## How to Operate on Vectors (this is also true for dataframes)

+ Everything below are base R commands using base R functions

`sum(newvector)`  
**`sum(newvector[c(2,3)])`**  

`mean(newvector)`  
`sd(newvector)`  
`range(newvector)`  
**`summary(newvector)`**



```
## [1] 15
```

```
## [1] 5
```

```
## [1] 3
```

```
## [1] 1.581139
```

```
## [1] 1 5
```

```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##       1       2       3       3       4       5
