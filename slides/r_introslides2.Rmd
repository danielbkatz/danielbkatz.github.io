# Enough Putzing about, Let's get to Data

+ The type of data structure you will most likely work with in R is the dataframe. Or, data.frame. 

+ Other common types of data structures:
  + `matrix`
  + `lists`
  + `arrays` 

--
+ An array is a general multidimensional data structure 
  + mindblowingly, a matrix that essentially has an x, y, and a z axis 
  
-- 

+ One can make lists of matrices or dataframes, and lists can be IN, dataframes
  + For instance, sometimes, you want to do the same thing to a number of dataframes.
  + If you put them in a list, you have a method for doing this very easily (we'll see later)

## Getting data sets in to R with the `readr` package
+ The first challenge: getting data into R

+ R needs a path (where the file that contains the data is)

+ R needs a command to read in the data

+ We're going to use the [_**`readr`**_](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package to handle most file types

+ However, the `foreign` package and `haven` can handle files from SAS, SPSS, STATA (and probably others)

  + You don't need SPSS, SAS, or STATA to read data into R

---

## First, things first
+ Download the data!

+ The data today is a publically accessible dataset from the [_**California Department of Education**_](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/filescohort.asp)

+ What you'll want to do is download the most recent year (cohort16) from the website to your computer (eventually you'll just use R to do this)

+ And put it in your working directory?

+ My what?

```{r}
# this will tell you the file path of your current working directory. The best thing is to put it here, since your Rproject is here. 
getwd()

#Try to find where this is on your computer, manually.

```

---

## Read in the data, the cheating way...
+ First create a new script in R, save it, and call it something that tells you we started learning the tidyverse.

+ In the top right, right under the Environment tab, it'll say "Import Dataset"

+ The file we downloaded is a CSV file (make sure to use readr)

+ Select `Import Dataset` > `From Text (readr)` > `Browse` > Find the dataset*, select, and open > look at the preview

+ If it doesn't look right, you can play with the settings (probably have to change, delimiter)



## Don't import yet!

---

## The final steps
+ In the lower right, there is some code, copy it and cancel out

+ Paste the code into your new script; write a note about what it is

+ Eventually, you'll want to do this manually, I promise (and please promise me)

```{r echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics("importing.jpg")

```

+ Run all the code...

---
## Code for Reading in 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Now that I've put my files in a rawdata folder in the working directory, I can do this:

# Load the library
library(readr)

cohort16 <- read_csv("RawData/cohort16.csv")
View(cohort16)



#Alternatively you can save the object location (makes life easier)

# Assign a variable with a string value of the file location.
cohortdata <- "RawData/cohort16.csv"

# Put the variable in your function, `read_delim`
cohort16 <- read_csv(cohortdata)

# Note the View(function) - Let's you see the data
#View(cohort16)
```

---
class: middle

### Can also go searching for it with a longer path (doesn't need to be in your working directory)
```{r readin}

cohort16 <- read_csv("C:/Users/katzd/Desktop/Teaching R/Extrablanl/Newproj/RawData/cohort16.csv")
```
  
---
## A Rare Best Practice

1. It is recommend that you create, in your working directory, folders just for the initial raw data (this data isn't to be altered)

2. Another folder in your working directory just for altered datasets (with computed variables, cleaned, or otherwise changed data)

3. Another folder just for statistical output and plots (or divide)

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("directory.jpg")

```

*(if you put it in your working directory, you'll see it straight away, if not, you'll have to find it)

# Introducing `dplyr`
[_**`dplyr`**_](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) is a package full of "verbs" that help us work on data. Some major verbs are

+ `select()` allows us to select or deselect columns by name

+ `filter()` allows us to filter rows by certain values

+ `mutate` allows us to create/compute new variables

---

## Data Sense

Let's get a sense of the data
```{r}
#get variable names

names(cohort16)

```
---
Get the first 10 rows
```{r}
head(cohort16)

```


---
## Using select to get RID of a column
We notice that the first column in the dataset is called `X1.` This column is added automatically when a dataframe is exported to csv from R. Let's get rid of it.  

We use a `-sign` before the column name. That's it. 

```{r}
co16_rem <- select(cohort16, -X1)

#non_tidyverse solution
co16_rem <- cohort16[-1]

#make sure this worked
names(co16_rem)

```

---


# (Re-Introducing Select)
+ Let's say, we want to know about average graduation rates by subgroup
  + For the entire state
  + Among Males and Females 
  + For districts 
  + That aren't charter schools
  
Make life easier, just select the needed columns with `select(data.framename, variable names to be selected, seperated by a column)`
```{r}
gencohort16 <- select(co16_rem, CDS, Name, AggLevel, DFC, Subgroup, Subgrouptype, NumCohort, NumGraduates)

```

Easy! 

---

## Introducing `filter()` and pipe operators `%>%`

+ I know that in the `Name` column, there's a Name called, `Statewide`

+ `filter` literally filters rows that meet a certain rule, such as equaling a value

+ `filter(df_name, rule)
```{r}
statemfco16 <- filter(gencohort16, Name=="Statewide")

```
+ However, we don't want to create a new object in R every time you perform an operation. 

+ The `%>%` operator, helps - read it as `and then`. 

Let's make that make sense

```{r}
statemfco16 <- co16_rem %>% 
  select(CDS, Name, AggLevel, DFC, Subgroup, Subgrouptype, NumCohort, NumGraduates) %>%
  filter(Name=="Statewide")


```


--- 


## Checking our work

+ Remember when we talked about `class`?

+ Well, let's make sure `CDS` which is a school ID, is of class 'character`, how will we do this?

+ We don't want school ID to be a "numeric" variable of some sort - It's an ID so leading zeros matter

+ Using another R index tool, `$`, which selects column by name (auto complete should show you the name).
```{r eval= FALSE}
class(co16_rem$CDS)
```  

What about all variables?

```{r eval=FALSE}
str(co16_rem)

```

+ Easy!
